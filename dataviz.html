                <p> An important part of developing a solution to a problem is collecting, visualizing and analyzing quantitive data. We've attempted to gain insights into what would influence students to attend school events.</p>

                <h2> Survey Data Set</h2>
                <p> To collect additional data on high school students and new college students we created a <a href=" https://forms.gle/LjshQdFKfXCveTQu5"> survey</a>. The goal of this survey was collect primary data on our target market. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>A few conclusions can be drawn from the data collected through the survey. Firstly, everyone has different habits and wants for the number of events that they attend. There are outliers, such as the person who attends 40 events per year. Because of this an incentive system may be more or less effective depending on who is targeted. </p>
                <br/>
                <p> Additonally, there is some variation in how people respond to specific incentives. The most popular incentive is small value gift cards, closely followed by extra credit.  </p>
                <br/>
                <p>We also looked at data from Statista on the percentage of US Households that have attended high school sports game. Predictions are set to remain fairly low. This demonstrates that there is low outside interest in high school sports from parents and other family members.</p>
