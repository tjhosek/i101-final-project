                <h1>The Solution</h1>
                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    A local High School is having problems getting students to attend events. They want to increase their attendance and get statistics on events that are being attended.
                </p>
                <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Our soulution takes the form of an app for not only event managers, but also for students and teachers. Thus, the app is split into two interfaces: one for event organizers and teachers and one for students.
                </p>
                <h3>Organizer Side</h3>
                <p>
                    Organizers will be able to create new events and edit existing ones. Events will have the following attributes:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Date and Time: When the event will take place and for how long.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Location: Where the event will be. This could be many things, such as a room, building, campus, or other locale.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Optionality: Whether the event is mandatory for students, and what students will have to go to the event.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Incentive: A reward for students who attend the event, whether through the in app point system or some external form of reward, such as extra credit or raffles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            People: Who will be organizing, managing, providing, and attending the event. This could include bands that may play or people who may give presentations.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Organizers will need to be able to change all aspects of an event at any time, and any notable changes will automatically notify the students who plan to attend. The app should interface with social media in order to provide information about notable people attending the event. Organizers will also be able to scan students into events, as to ensure attendance. Cross-organization with other event organizers is also extremely important, as is interfacing with file storage apps 
                </p>
                <h3>Attendee Side</h3>
                <p>
                    Attendees will be able to browse local events, be informed of mandatory events, and use the in app point system to claim rewards. Attendees will also be able to use the app to scan into events to show attendance. Attendees should be able to see most of the information provided for an event by the organizers. Importantly, attendees should be able to rsvp to events, enabling them to recieve notifications about updates and enabling organizers to get a sense of how many people will be attending.
                </p>
                <h3>Point System</h3>
                <p>
                    An in app point system will be implemented in order to relieve some of the stress over organizing incentives. The system is entirely optional, and alternative real world incentives can be used in place of it. The point system gives points for attending events. Value and weight of points is defined by the event organizers, as is the rewards. Example rewards for accumulating enough points include off-campus lunch, coupons and discounts at spirit stores, extra credit points, etc. Points can also be used for a ranking system, possibly giving more advanced or detailed profile pictures, cosmetic changes for the app, and a competetive enticement to do better than other students
                </p>
                <h2>How this Solves the Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Our solution addresses the problem of low attendance by using the effectiveness of a point system as a way to get people interested in events. Point systems, while being inherently arbitrary, are exciting for people; By making the accumulation of points something that gives rewards we make attending events a more inticing option. This does come with the potential drawback of students only going to events to get points, so it must be tempered with real world rewards and mandatory events.

                    By organizing events solely through the app, attending and orchestrating events becomes much more streamlined and available for students. This means that event organizers will have to worry less about advertising events.
                </p>
                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <p>
                    Our target audience for this app are schools looking to organize events. By making the point systems optional and arbitrary, the app becomes generaly applicable to many different schools. By making the app accessable to both organizers and students, communication becomes clearer between the two groups, resulting in better organized and orchestrated events.

                    The main key to this app is making it applicable to different situtations. Schools vary wildly accross different locations, levels, and populations, and will therefore have different needs. General applicability is more important than specificity in this scenario. This in mind, the app is only intended for school based events. Large scale public events would not work due to the difficulty of forcing event goers to download an app. Additionally, not all students or teachers will have access to mobile phones, so the app should not be the only form of incentive, attendance and advertisement.
                </p>
                <h2>Possible Reactions</h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating technology into school settings can be a turbulent process. People often get used to the systems in place and may have difficulty initially adjusting to the app, but as time goes on and more people become aquanted with it, this animosity can be expected to fade. What the school ends up with is a streamlined event management software, allowing for attendance tracking and automated rewards. This is a significant boon to event organizers, who will now be able to focus on the event itself rather than the advertisement and attendance. Students will likely find the point system encouraging, and have better access to information about upcoming events that they might not have had otherwise.
