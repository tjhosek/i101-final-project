                <h3>Smart Attendance System Applying QR Code - Google Scholar Article Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this article on smart attendance, the authors decribe a way to better track attendance at school. While for years the method has been to use a pen and paper, there are better ways coming up that will decrease the time it takes to take attendance for a class. The method that is proposed is the QR code reader. The way it would work is by using a webcam attached to a computer that scans the QR code and then the data is stored in a database. The paper lays out how this is all done and also how to use Reed Solomon error code correction to make sure the QR codes are authentic.

                    <p>
                        The article lays out background study on many other methods of attendance which have been used. There have been uses of face detection, fingerprint verification, as well as taking attendance using bluetooth on each student's mobile phone. The article then proceeds to focus on the system of QR codes and how it is implemented. It says that a Quick Response (QR) Code is just a 2-D code used to capture thousnads of characters and numbers all in one small image. It is arranged in blocks of black and white which is converted into coded information when scanned.

                    <p>
                        Despite the simplicity and ease of use for QR codes, there can be erros such as unclear or damaged images. In order to fix the errors that will occur with QR codes, the Reed Solomon software is used. The Reed Solomon algorithm converts the available black and white blocks into a polynomial function that uniquely describes each point. It is then able to predict the rest of the blocks. The article then lays out a flowchart for how the attendance tracker works step by step. This chart includes registering, opening the app, logging into the system, and scanning the code. After these steps are complete, the information is sent and stored to a database to be available for access later.

                <h3>Using the Campus Web Site to Track Student Attendance - ACM Portal Article Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                    This article outlines how William Woods University in Missouri used renewable scholarships to encourage event attendance. The program is called LEAD and is designed to benefit students with award money while also benefiting the university as a whole with more people attending events. It offered up to 5000 dollars in rewards renewable up to 4 years for students who were ready to attend lectures, films, sporting events, clubs, and other events on a regular basis. The program required students to get 45 points a year and 4 points for each month to stay in it. A sports game was worth half a point while a lecture was worth one and a half points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The database for the event allowed students to find events to attend and check their points total for both month and year. The university created the database using Access 2000. They used student IDs to keep track of attendance. These all had barcodes on them which made scanning into events easier. After a scanner at an events was used, it was taken to an office and the information was transferred to the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The article then layed out their evaluation of the program. They said that the scanners worked well throughout the process but for one time. The article also points out that it was essential to make sure students were informed on the total of their points so that they wouldn't get behind. To do this, they sent out letters and emails warning of monthly deadlines and also providing access to the points through the campus website. The article also had to move its database from Access to an SQL server because the attendance table had gotten too big.

                <h3>Whova Article Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                    This article was written by Whova and it outlines 8 different tools to use for any type of event planning. The article starts off by pointing out that it is hard to plan for an event of large scale. To better plan, different software will help track attendance and satisfaction. The best way to determine which software is by asking questions about the needs for the events. The event planner must know if the software they are looking for needs to be mobile friendly, whether or not it has good reviews, and also how easy it is to use the software for their specific event.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Some of the best event management software is laid out by the article. For a small event that has all the tools you need to plan, a person could use Eventbrite to help manage tickets. If a user is looking for a conference event planner, OpenConf is great for paper submissions and even pier review content. Trello is another software more resembling a to-do list software but it can be great for tracking the progress of tasks that need to be done. If a user needs to have a seating chart for their event, a perfect software would be Social Tables, which creates a room layout and checks in the guests.

                    <p>
                    Another software that tends to be more on the expensive side, but is perfect for trade shows and other large events is DoubleDutch. For any event planning looking to put live feed of social media responses on a big screen, there is a great solution with Everwall. And finally, in order to create a website for an event, WordPress Theme can do that. All of these different softwares can be used to better help event planners organize and plan ahead. The article shows that there isn’t one single app or website that’s right for everyone, but that each event needs a different solution, and there is a lot of different software to do that.

                <h3>Odell Bizzell Article Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                    This article, written by professional business speaker Odell A. Bizzell II, outlines a series of steps which he finds to increase attendance to events on college campuses. His experience with organizing and running seminars and events on college campuses around the country has given him insight into the various cultural, logistical, and timing-based qualities that make events more appealing for students. He emphasizes proper organizing in getting the word out about the event well ahead of time and whether or not events should be mandatory. He also emphasizes cultural aspects of campus by understanding the flow of students and providing incentives for students to show up at lectures, such as free gear or unique opportunities. Finally, creating a sense of urgency and getting professors to provide extra credit ensure that more people will show up at events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This group has decided to use this article in an attempt to better understand the aspects that make successful lectures appealing to students. The insight from this article helps to better clarify what aspects of the website should be focused on and what should be deprioritized. Granted, college campuses and High Schools are very different environments, but there are general principles that can be derived from experience with events in any academic setting, and making the site adaptable to more situations increases its profitability and reach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This article has many important lessons as it pertains to designing the website. For one, it emphasizes incentivising events, either through academic credit or some other means. A built-in modular incentive system might be a good idea as a way to abstract this process and relieve the event planners of some stress. This has further implications, as it means interfacing with students, teachers, and event organizers will all have different overall effects. Some way to make events mandatory would be another possible addition, and a more direct way of ensuring attendance.
